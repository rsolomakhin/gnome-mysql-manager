                      MySQL Manager - Gnome GUI
                     ===========================

Simple tool for managing MySQL database. Features include managing
databases, users, and permissions. The tool is written using pygtk,
python-gnome, and python-mysqldb.


 Why use mysql manager?
------------------------

I wrote this tool when I was working with Ruby on Rails, and
Drupal. These require MySQL databases, but constantly creating and
removing databases and users from command line was, and still is, a
hustle. This tool is intended for easy management of MySQL databases
and users, and it does this task well (am I being bias?).


 Using mysql manager
---------------------

Read INSTALL for installation and starting instructions. There is a
usage tutorial on the project wiki website:

 Error handling
----------------

When an error occurs, the user is notified via an error dialog. There
are no undo, backup, or restore options.


 Reporting bugs
----------------

If you find a bug in MySQL Manager, or would like to suggest
(implement, maybe?) a feature, please file a bug at:
